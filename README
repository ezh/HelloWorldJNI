It is not so easy to find project for scala with JNI call.

The first step is always the hardest. I want to make it a bit easy for others.

Please note, that javah generate
  org_digimead_HelloWorldJNI__.h

make generate
  liborg_digimead_HelloWorldJNI.so

and scala code call
  org_digimead_HelloWorldJNI

It is confusing a lot at the beginning.

Also there is a simple build.sbt. Please call 'sbt compile' 'sbt clean' directly to use GNU make

Best regards.
